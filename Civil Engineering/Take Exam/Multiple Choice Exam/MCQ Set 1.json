    "question": "What is the SI unit of stress?",
    "options": ["Newton (N)", "Pascal (Pa)", "Joule (J)", "Watt (W)"],
    "correct": "Pascal (Pa)",
    "explanation": "Stress is force per unit area, so its SI unit is Pascal (Pa) which equals N/m²."

  {
    "question": "Which of the following materials has the highest Young's modulus?",
    "options": ["Rubber", "Aluminum", "Steel", "Wood"],
    "correct": "Steel",
    "explanation": "Steel has a Young's modulus of about 200 GPa, which is higher than aluminum (70 GPa), wood (10 GPa), and rubber (0.01-0.1 GPa)."
  },
  {
    "question": "The point where bending moment changes sign is called:",
    "options": ["Neutral axis", "Shear center", "Point of contraflexure", "Elastic limit"],
    "correct": "Point of contraflexure",
    "explanation": "Point of contraflexure is where bending moment is zero and changes from positive to negative or vice versa."

    "options": ["0 to 0.1", "0.1 to 0.2", "0.2 to 0.5", "0.5 to 1.0"],
    "correct": "0.2 to 0.5",
    "explanation": "Most metals have Poisson's ratio between 0.2 and 0.5. For example, steel is about 0.3."

      "Yield stress / Ultimate stress",
      "Ultimate stress / Yield stress"
    ],
    "correct": "Ultimate stress / Working stress",
    "explanation": "Factor of safety = Ultimate stress (or yield stress) divided by Allowable (working) stress."
