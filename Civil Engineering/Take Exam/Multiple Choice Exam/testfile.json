    "options": ["Short columns", "Long columns", "All columns", "Intermediate columns"],
    "correct": "Long columns",
    "explanation": "Euler's formula P_cr = π²EI/(KL)² applies to long slender columns where buckling occurs before yielding."

    "options": ["L/r", "r/L", "L²/r", "r²/L"],
    "correct": "L/r",
    "explanation": "Slenderness ratio = Effective length / Radius of gyration = KL/r. Determines whether column is short or long."

    "correct": "Thin plate elements",
    "explanation": "Local buckling = buckling of thin plate elements (flanges, webs) before overall column buckling. Common in steel sections."
