    "question": "What is the unit of stress in the SI system?",
    "options": [
      "Newton (N)",
      "Pascal (Pa)",
      "Joule (J)",
      "Watt (W)"
    ],
    "correct": "Pascal (Pa)",
    "explanation": "Stress is defined as force per unit area. In SI units, force is in Newtons and area in square meters, so stress is N/m² which is Pascal."

    "question": "Which of the following is NOT a type of structural load?",
    "options": [
      "Dead load",
      "Live load",
      "Wind load",
      "Material load"
    ],
    "correct": "Material load",
    "explanation": "The main types of structural loads are dead load, live load, wind load, earthquake load, snow load, etc. 'Material load' is not a standard term."

    "question": "The Young's modulus of a material is a measure of its:",
    "options": [
      "Ductility",
      "Stiffness",
      "Toughness",
      "Hardness"
    ],
    "correct": "Stiffness",
    "explanation": "Young's modulus (E) represents the stiffness of a material, defined as the ratio of stress to strain in the elastic region."
