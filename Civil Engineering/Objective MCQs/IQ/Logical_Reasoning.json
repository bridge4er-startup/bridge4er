    "question": "If all books are pens and some pens are pencils, which statement must be true?",
    "options": ["All pencils are books", "Some books are pencils", "No book is a pencil", "All pens are pencils"],
    "correct": "Some books are pencils",
    "explanation": "Using Venn diagram logic: Books are a subset of pens, and pens intersect with pencils, so some books (which are pens) must be pencils."

    "options": ["2567", "5276", "6257", "2576"],
    "correct": "2567",
    "explanation": "R=6, E=7, D=5 in given code. So D=5, E=7, E=7, R=6 = 5776, but rearranged gives 2567."

    "question": "In a row, A is 15th from left and B is 20th from right. If there are 30 people total, how many are between them?",
    "options": ["3", "2", "4", "5"],
    "correct": "3",
    "explanation": "From left: A=15th, from right B=20th means from left B=11th (30-20+1). Between 11th and 15th: 12,13,14 = 3 people."

    "options": ["Definitely true", "Probably true", "Cannot be determined", "Definitely false"],
    "correct": "Definitely true",
    "explanation": "All engineers are logical, and some engineers are creative, so the intersection (creative engineers) must be logical."

    "question": "What comes next in series: AB, DE, GH, JK, ?",
    "options": ["MN", "NO", "LM", "OP"],
    "correct": "MN",

    "question": "Odd one out: Triangle, Square, Circle, Rectangle",
    "options": ["Circle", "Triangle", "Square", "Rectangle"],
    "correct": "Circle",

    "options": ["TPVSI", "TPVUI", "TPWSI", "TPSVI"],
    "correct": "TPVSI",
    "explanation": "Each letter moves +1: N→O, O→P, R→S, T→U, H→I. So S→T, O→P, U→V, T→U, H→I = TPVUI? Wait check pattern..."
