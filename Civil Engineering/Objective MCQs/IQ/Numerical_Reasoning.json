    "options": ["24", "32", "30", "20"],
    "correct": "32",
    "explanation": "Geometric progression with common ratio 2: 2×2=4, 4×2=8, 8×2=16, 16×2=32."

    "question": "Numerical analogy: 12:144 as 15:?",
    "options": ["180", "225", "165", "195"],
    "correct": "225",
    "explanation": "12:12²=144, similarly 15:15²=225."

    "options": ["25", "36", "49", "All are perfect squares"],
    "correct": "All are perfect squares",
    "explanation": "All numbers are perfect squares: 4²=16, 5²=25, 6²=36, 7²=49, 8²=64."

    "question": "If a shirt costs ₹800 after 20% discount, what was original price?",
    "options": ["₹1000", "₹960", "₹1040", "₹1200"],
    "correct": "₹1000",
    "explanation": "Discounted price = 80% of original. 800 = 0.8×OP, so OP = 800/0.8 = ₹1000."

    "question": "The ratio of boys to girls is 3:2. If there are 30 boys, how many girls?",
    "options": ["15", "20", "25", "45"],
    "correct": "20",
    "explanation": "Boys:Girls = 3:2. 30 boys = 3 parts, so 1 part = 10. Girls = 2 parts = 20."

    "question": "Average of 5 numbers is 20. If four numbers are 15, 25, 20, 10, what is fifth?",
    "options": ["30", "25", "20", "35"],
    "correct": "30",
    "explanation": "Total of 5 numbers = 20×5 = 100. Sum of given four = 15+25+20+10 = 70. Fifth number = 100-70 = 30."

    "options": ["₹1000", "₹1100", "₹1200", "₹900"],
    "correct": "₹1000",
    "explanation": "Let A's cost = x. B's price = 1.2x. C's price = 1.1×1.2x = 1.32x = 1320. So x = 1320/1.32 = ₹1000."

    "options": ["3 days", "4 days", "4.5 days", "5 days"],
    "correct": "4 days",
    "explanation": "A's 1 day work = 1/6, B's = 1/12. Together = 1/6+1/12 = 3/12 = 1/4. So 4 days."

    "options": ["Statement 1 alone sufficient", "Statement 2 alone sufficient", "Both needed", "Neither sufficient"],
    "correct": "Statement 2 alone sufficient",
    "explanation": "(1) x²>y² doesn't guarantee x>y (could be both negative). (2) x-y>0 directly means x>y."
